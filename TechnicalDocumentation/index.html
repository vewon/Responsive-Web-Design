        <p>Night City is the sprawling metropolis where Cyberpunk 2077 takes place. It’s a dystopian city controlled by mega-corporations and unassailed by the laws of both country and state. It exhibits a wide range of aesthetics, from futuristic skyscrapers to decaying urban districts. The city is divided into various unique regions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>City Center: This is the heart of Night City, filled with corporate offices and skyscrapers. It’s the symbol of the power held by mega-corporations.</li>
          <li>Watson: A unique mix of Asian cultures, Watson is a fallen corporate giant now populated by immigrants, hiding various bazaars and markets in its streets.</li>
          <li>Westbrook: Known for its luxurious lifestyles, Westbrook is where you go if you want to flash your eddies. It’s home to the wealthy elite of Night City.
Heywood: A suburban housing district, home to the middle class and corporate employees.</li>
          <li>Pacifica: The most dangerous part of town, abandoned and overrun by gang activity. Not a place for a casual stroll.</li>
          <li>Santo Domingo: All of Night City’s power comes from here, with its countless power plants and industrial factories.</li>
          <li>Dogtown: A new map region introduced in the Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty DLC. It is a part of Night City, situated next to Pacifica and has its own unique locations, quests, and features. Dogtown can be unlocked by exploring it after completing certain main story quests or starting the Phantom Liberty expansion.</li>
          <li>The outskirts of Night City that include the surrounding areas. It is a stark contrast to the city proper, with plains, emptiness, oil fields, and rural locations. The Badlands are home to the Nomads and is one of the Life Path starting locations. Players who chose the Nomad Life Path will begin here.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Cyberpunk 2077 is a role-playing game that puts a lot of emphasis on player choice. This is reflected in its branching storyline, which can change based on the decisions you make throughout the game. The story is non-linear, meaning you can approach objectives in multiple ways, and your choices can lead to different outcomes.</p>

        <p>Player choice is also evident in the game’s character classes. At the beginning of the game, you can choose to be a NetRunner (specializing in hacking), a Techie (specializing in machinery), or a Solo (specializing in combat). However, the game uses a fluid class system, meaning you’re not locked into any one class and can mix and match skills as you progress.</p>

        <p>Your choices extend to the character’s backstory as well. You can choose between a Street Kid, Nomad, or Corpo life path, each providing a different starting point and background for your character, V.</p>

        <p>These mechanics come together to create a rich, immersive experience that adapts to your playstyle, making each playthrough unique.</p>

        <h1>Creating your character, V.</h1>
        <p>When you start a new game in Cyberpunk 2077, you’ll be asked to create your character, V. This involves several steps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Choosing Your Life Path: You can choose between three life paths - Nomad, Street Kid, and Corpo. Each life path provides a different starting point and background for your character, and will affect your character’s dialogue options and how the story unfolds.</li>
          <li>Customizing Appearance: Cyberpunk 2077 offers a deep character customization system. You can adjust your character’s body type, skin tone, eyes, nose, mouth, jaw, ears, and hairstyle. You can also add various extras like scars, tattoos, piercings, makeup, and more.</li>
          <li>Distributing Attributes: You’ll also need to distribute attribute points across five categories - Body, Intelligence, Reflexes, Technical Ability, and Cool. Each attribute affects different aspects of gameplay. For example, Body increases your health and melee damage, while Intelligence improves your hacking abilities.</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Customization Options Throughout the Game</h1>
        <p>As you progress through Cyberpunk 2077, you’ll have the opportunity to further customize your character in various ways:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Cyberware: Cyberware are cybernetic enhancements that can be installed into your character’s body. These can provide various benefits, such as increased strength, improved hacking abilities, or new abilities like double jumping or slow motion. Cyberware can be purchased from Ripperdocs throughout Night City.</li>
          <li>Skills: As you use different abilities in the game, you’ll gain experience in those abilities and unlock new skills. For example, using handguns will improve your Handguns skill, which can unlock perks like increased reload speed or improved accuracy.</li>
          <li>Clothing: Clothing in Cyberpunk 2077 is not just cosmetic - it also provides armor and can have various mods installed for additional benefits. You can find clothing by looting, purchasing from vendors, or as quest rewards.</li>

        <div class="divider"></div>
        <p>By default, Cyberpunk 2077 uses mouse and keyboard for the PC version. A gamepad may be used if connected.</p>
        <p>The user interface in Cyberpunk 2077 provides a lot of information. Here are some of the key elements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Health Bar: Located at the top left of the screen, the health bar shows your current health. If this bar empties, your character will die.</li>
          <li>Mini-Map: Located at the top right of the screen, the mini-map shows your immediate surroundings and highlights points of interest and mission objectives.</li>
          <li>Dialogue Options: During conversations, dialogue options will appear at the bottom of the screen. You can choose your response using the numbered keys.</li>
          <li>Inventory: When you open your inventory, you can see the items you’re carrying, your equipped weapons and clothing, and your character’s stats. You can also install cyberware and level up your skills from this screen.</li>

        <h1>Combat System</h1>
        <p>Cyberpunk 2077’s combat system is a blend of gunplay, melee combat, and hacking. Here are some key elements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Weapons: The game offers a wide range of weapons, from handguns and rifles to katanas and cyberware implants. Each weapon has its own stats and can be customized with mods.</li>
          <li>Cyberware: These are cybernetic enhancements that you can install in your character’s body. They can provide various benefits, such as increased strength, improved hacking abilities, or new abilities like double jumping or slow motion.</li>
          <li>Tactics: The game allows for different combat styles. You can go in guns blazing, use stealth to take down enemies unnoticed, or use your hacking skills to turn the environment and enemy tech against them.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Dialogue System</h1>
        <p>The dialogue system in Cyberpunk 2077 is dynamic and choices matter. Dialogues are split between Yellow and Blue dialogue choices. When you make a Yellow choice, the conversation will continue, and you won’t be able to go back. On the other hand, Blue choices simply provide extra information for the player’s context. Your choices can affect character reactions, the direction that a mission takes, and your potential rewards.</p>
        <h1>Exploration and Interaction</h1>
        <p>Exploration in Cyberpunk 2077 is rewarded with new quests, lore, and loot. Here are some tips:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Scanner: Use the scanner frequently, especially in large rooms. It can show items you can pick up, explosives, and other helpful things.</li>
          <li>Loot: Collect everything. It can slow you down a bit, but every now and then you’ll pick up something that’s worth a lot. The junk adds up, too.</li>
          <li>Fast Travel: Keep an eye out for blue markers on your map while you explore Night City. Those are Fast Travel points.</li>
          <li>Safety: Look both ways when crossing the street – yes, really. You can get hit by cars and you will take damage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Solutions to Common Game Issues</h1>

        <ul>
          <li>Lag, Stuttering, or FPS Drop: This can often be solved by verifying the integrity of the game files1. Right-click on the game in your library, go to “Properties”, click on the “Local Files” tab, and then click on "Verify Integrity of Game Files". If your games stutter all the time, it’s possible that there’s a bottleneck in the system somewhere.</li>
          <li>Game Not Launching or Opening: Some solutions include running Cyberpunk 2077 as an Administrator, allowing Cyberpunk 2077 through Windows Firewall Settings, launching the game directly from the executable file, verifying the integrity of game files, moving the game to an SSD, downloading and installing Microsoft Visual C++, disabling fullscreen optimizations, and clean installing your graphics driver.</li>
          <li>Crashing on Launch: Some of these issues can be resolved by disabling cross saves, restarting the game, and turning off graphic options like motion blur and film grain.</li>
        </ul>
