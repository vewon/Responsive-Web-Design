      <div id="tribute-div">

        <p>V, alongside her partner Jackie Welles, embarked on their first major assignment, a job from a fixer, Dexter DeShawn.</p>
        <p>Their mission led them to infiltrate Konpeki Plaza, where they successfully stole a Relic from the powerful Arasaka corporation.</p>
        <p>To prevent further damage to the stolen Relic, V inserted the shard into her neural interface.</p>
        <p>In a shocking turn of events, Dexter DeShawn shot V. However, the Relic brought her back to life.</p>
        <p>This event led to V's fateful encounter with Johnny Silverhand.</p>
        <p>V continued her journey as a mercenary, eventually earning the reputation as the best merc in the Afterlife.</p>
        <p>She eventually left Night City alongside Judy Alvarez.</p>
